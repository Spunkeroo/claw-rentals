The bare essentials (mattress, bedding, towels, basic kitchen supplies, bathroom items, and cleaning supplies) cost about $500-800. Adding furniture like a couch, table, and dresser brings it to $1,500-2,500. Buying everything brand new from a single store will cost $3,000-5,000+. Save money by buying used furniture from Facebook Marketplace, thrift stores, and estate sales. Prioritize spending on things that affect sleep and comfort: a good mattress is worth more than a fancy coffee table."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What should I buy first for my first apartment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Buy things in this order of priority: First night essentials (mattress or air mattress, bedding, towels, toilet paper, soap, trash bags). Day 2-3: basic kitchen items (pot, pan, plates, cups, utensils, dish soap). First week: cleaning supplies, shower curtain, bathroom essentials. First month: furniture, storage solutions, and comfort items. Do not try to buy everything before moving in. Live in the space first and figure out what you actually need versus what you think you need."}},

Also commonly forgotten: setting up utilities (electric, gas, water, internet) before move-in day, renters insurance, and change of address with USPS."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is renters insurance necessary for a first apartment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, and many landlords require it. Renters insurance costs $15-30 per month and covers your belongings against theft, fire, water damage, and other disasters. It also provides liability coverage if someone gets injured in your apartment. Without it, if your apartment floods or catches fire, you lose everything with no reimbursement. Your landlord's insurance covers the building but not your stuff inside it. For $15-30 a month, renters insurance is one of the best financial protections available for apartment dwellers."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What kitchen items do I actually need for a first apartment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Start minimal. You need one good pot, one good pan, a baking sheet, a cutting board, a chef knife, a spatula, a wooden spoon, and a can opener. For dishes: 4 plates, 4 bowls, 4 cups, and a basic set of flatware for 4. Add dish soap, a sponge, and a dish rack. That is it for the first week. Add a slow cooker or rice cooker later if you want them. Do not buy a full 50-piece kitchen set. You will use 10 items and the rest will take up space you do not have."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How can I save money furnishing my first apartment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are goldmines for used furniture at 50-80% off retail. Thrift stores like Goodwill and Habitat for Humanity ReStore have affordable furniture and household items. Ask family and friends if they have spare furniture. IKEA has the best prices for new budget furniture. Buy slowly over time instead of all at once. Use moving boxes as temporary nightstands until you find what you actually want. Free furniture appears on curbs and in Buy Nothing groups regularly. The only things worth buying new are your mattress and pillows for hygiene reasons."}}

<h1>First Apartment Checklist: Everything You Need (2026)</h1>

<p>Moving into your first apartment is one of the most exciting things you will ever do. It is also one of the most overwhelming. You walk into an empty space and suddenly realize you own nothing. No plates. No towels. No shower curtain. No plunger. Definitely no plunger. And nobody tells you that you need a plunger until you desperately need a plunger.</p>

<p>This <strong>first apartment checklist</strong> covers absolutely everything you need, organized by room and priority level. I split every category into "buy immediately" (things you need on night one), "buy first week" (things that make life functional), and "buy first month" (things that make life comfortable). This way you do not blow your entire budget at Target on day one and end up eating cereal on the floor because you bought a decorative lamp instead of a bowl.</p>

<p>I also included realistic costs so you can budget properly, plus smart shopping tips that will save you hundreds. Let us get your first apartment set up right.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="before">Before You Move In</h2>

<p>These are the things you need to handle before you even start moving boxes. Skip these and your first week will be miserable.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Set up utilities:</strong> Electric, gas, water, and internet. Do this 1-2 weeks before move-in. Showing up to an apartment with no electricity is a bad start.</li>
<li><strong>Get renters insurance:</strong> $15-30/month. Many landlords require it. It protects your stuff against theft, fire, and water damage. Get it before moving your belongings in.</li>
<li><strong>Change your address:</strong> USPS address forwarding, bank, credit cards, subscriptions, employer. Do this the week before you move.</li>
<li><strong>Document the apartment condition:</strong> Take photos and video of every room, every wall, every scratch before moving anything in. Email them to yourself and your landlord. This protects your security deposit when you move out.</li>
<li><strong>Get copies of your keys:</strong> Make spare keys immediately. Lock yourself out once and you will wish you had done this.</li>
<li><strong>Measure everything:</strong> Doorways, hallways, and rooms. Know the dimensions before buying furniture so that couch actually fits through the door.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="night-one">Night One Survival Kit</h2>

<p>Pack these items separately so you can find them immediately when you arrive. Everything else can wait until tomorrow.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mattress or air mattress:</strong> Sleep is not optional. An <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YJSG1PP?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">air mattress</a> ($25-40) works great until your real mattress arrives.</li>
<li><strong>Sheets, pillow, and blanket:</strong> One set is enough for now.</li>
<li><strong>Toilet paper:</strong> Trust me on this one.</li>
<li><strong>Hand soap and dish soap:</strong> Basic hygiene and cleanup.</li>
<li><strong>Towel:</strong> At least one bath towel.</li>
<li><strong>Phone charger and extension cord:</strong> Outlets might not be where you expect them.</li>
<li><strong>Trash bags:</strong> You will generate a lot of packaging waste on day one.</li>
<li><strong>Snacks and water:</strong> You probably will not have kitchen supplies set up yet.</li>
<li><strong>Basic medications:</strong> Pain reliever, allergy meds, anything you take daily.</li>
<li><strong>Flashlight or battery lantern:</strong> In case you cannot figure out the lights right away.</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>Night One Pro Tip</h3>
<p>Order pizza delivery on night one. You will be exhausted and have no kitchen setup. Eat pizza on the floor of your new apartment. It is a rite of passage. Enjoy it.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen Essentials</h2>

<h3>Buy First Week</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WV2TKH8?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One good pot</a> ($15-25):</strong> A 3-quart saucepan handles pasta, soup, rice, boiled eggs, and reheating.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009LV4JA6?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One good pan</a> ($15-25):</strong> A 10-inch nonstick skillet handles eggs, stir-fry, pancakes, grilled cheese, and most meals.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KKDJRND?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baking sheet</a> ($8):</strong> For oven meals, roasting vegetables, frozen pizza, and cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting board ($5-10):</strong> One basic plastic or wood board.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0845BXHDB?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chef knife</a> ($10-20):</strong> One decent knife handles 90% of kitchen tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Spatula and wooden spoon ($3-5):</strong> Your two essential cooking utensils.</li>
<li><strong>Can opener ($3):</strong> You will forget this until you need it.</li>
<li><strong>4 plates, 4 bowls, 4 cups ($10-15):</strong> Enough for you and a few guests.</li>
<li><strong>Flatware set for 4 ($8-12):</strong> Forks, knives, spoons.</li>
<li><strong>Dish soap, sponge, dish rack ($5-8):</strong> Basic cleanup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buy First Month</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Colander ($5):</strong> For draining pasta and washing produce.</li>
<li><strong>Measuring cups and spoons ($5):</strong> For following recipes.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing bowls ($8):</strong> A nesting set of 3 covers everything.</li>
<li><strong>Pot holders or oven mitts ($3):</strong> Do not burn yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Food storage containers ($8-12):</strong> For leftovers and meal prep.</li>
<li><strong>Slow cooker ($20-30):</strong> The best budget cooking appliance. Throw in ingredients in the morning, eat dinner when you get home.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee maker or kettle ($15-25):</strong> If you are a coffee or tea person.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bedroom">Bedroom Essentials</h2>

<h3>Buy Immediately</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q34VNF6?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mattress</a> ($200-400):</strong> This is the one item worth spending real money on. You spend 8 hours a day on it. A bed-in-a-box mattress from Amazon or Walmart runs $200-400 for a queen and is surprisingly good. Do not cheap out on sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Sheets, pillowcases, pillow ($30-50):</strong> One set to start. Buy a second set when budget allows so you can wash one while using the other.</li>
<li><strong>Comforter or duvet ($25-40):</strong> One warm blanket.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buy First Week</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hangers ($5-8):</strong> 20-30 hangers. Velvet non-slip hangers are worth the small upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Lamp ($10-15):</strong> Not every bedroom has good overhead lighting.</li>
<li><strong>Curtains or blackout shades ($10-20):</strong> Essential for sleep quality, especially if your window faces a streetlight or gets morning sun.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buy First Month</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bed frame ($50-150):</strong> A basic metal frame works fine. You can upgrade later.</li>
<li><strong>Dresser ($30-100):</strong> Buy used. Dressers are the most commonly available used furniture item.</li>
<li><strong>Nightstand ($10-30):</strong> Or use a stack of books, a moving box, or a cheap stool.</li>
<li><strong>Full-length mirror ($10-15):</strong> Useful and makes small rooms look bigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bathroom">Bathroom Essentials</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085TN3LY3?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shower curtain</a> and rings ($10-15):</strong> Most apartments do not include one. You will discover this mid-shower.</li>
<li><strong>Bath towels x2 ($10-15):</strong> Two so one can be in the wash.</li>
<li><strong>Hand towels x2 ($5):</strong> For the sink area.</li>
<li><strong>Bath mat ($8):</strong> Do not slip on wet tile.</li>
<li><strong>Toilet plunger ($5):</strong> Buy this BEFORE you need it.</li>
<li><strong>Toilet brush ($5):</strong> For cleaning.</li>
<li><strong>Trash can ($3-5):</strong> Small bathroom trash can with a lid.</li>
<li><strong>Toiletries:</strong> Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant. Bring what you already have.</li>
<li><strong>First aid kit ($8-15):</strong> Band-aids, antiseptic, pain reliever, cold medicine. Keep it in the bathroom.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="living">Living Room Essentials</h2>

<p>The living room is the lowest priority. You can live without a couch. You cannot live without a bed, kitchen, or bathroom. Furnish the living room last.</p>

<h3>Buy First Month</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Couch ($100-400):</strong> Buy used. Facebook Marketplace has couches for $50-200 that are perfectly fine. A new basic couch from IKEA or Amazon starts around $200-400.</li>
<li><strong>TV ($100-200):</strong> Optional. Many people use a laptop or tablet instead. If you want a TV, a 43-inch smart TV runs about $150-200.</li>
<li><strong>Lamp ($10-20):</strong> Overhead lighting is harsh. A floor lamp or table lamp makes the room livable.</li>
<li><strong>Small table ($15-50):</strong> For eating, working, or setting things down. A folding table works perfectly as a temporary dining table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buy Later</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bookshelf ($20-50):</strong> Storage and display. IKEA Kallax is the gold standard for apartment shelving.</li>
<li><strong>Rug ($20-40):</strong> Makes a room feel warmer and more finished. Covers ugly apartment carpet stains.</li>
<li><strong>Wall art ($0-20):</strong> Do not leave walls bare forever. Printable art from Etsy, thrift store frames, or your own photos add personality.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cleaning">Cleaning Supplies</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>All-purpose cleaner ($3):</strong> One spray bottle handles counters, sinks, stove, and most surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Toilet bowl cleaner ($3):</strong> Separate product for the toilet.</li>
<li><strong>Dish soap ($2):</strong> Also works for hand washing clothes in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Laundry detergent ($8-12):</strong> For laundromat trips or apartment machines.</li>
<li><strong>Sponges ($2):</strong> For dishes and counter wiping.</li>
<li><strong>Paper towels ($3-5):</strong> For everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Trash bags ($5):</strong> Kitchen size and small bathroom size.</li>
<li><strong>Broom and dustpan ($8-10):</strong> For hard floors.</li>
<li><strong>Vacuum ($30-60):</strong> If you have carpet. A basic stick vacuum works fine for apartments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools">Tools and Safety</h2>

<p>You need a small toolkit. Not a hardware store. Just the basics.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XELZ3C?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic tool kit</a> ($15-25):</strong> Screwdriver (Phillips and flathead), hammer, pliers, tape measure, level, and a utility knife. A small kit with all of these costs $15-25.</li>
<li><strong>Command hooks and strips ($5-10):</strong> Hang things without putting holes in the walls. Your security deposit will thank you.</li>
<li><strong>Fire extinguisher ($15-25):</strong> Every home should have one. Keep it in the kitchen.</li>
<li><strong>Smoke detector batteries ($3):</strong> Test the smoke detectors immediately. Replace batteries if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Flashlight ($5):</strong> For power outages.</li>
<li><strong>Duct tape ($3):</strong> Fixes temporarily. Everything.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget">Complete Budget Breakdown</h2>

<table class="savings-table">
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Bare Minimum</th><th>Comfortable</th><th>Full Setup</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bedroom</td><td>$255</td><td>$400</td><td>$650</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kitchen</td><td>$75</td><td>$150</td><td>$300</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bathroom</td><td>$50</td><td>$80</td><td>$120</td></tr>
<tr><td>Living Room</td><td>$0</td><td>$200</td><td>$500</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleaning</td><td>$30</td><td>$50</td><td>$80</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tools and Safety</td><td>$25</td><td>$50</td><td>$75</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>$435</strong></td><td><strong>$930</strong></td><td><strong>$1,725</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The bare minimum gets you through the first week with everything functional. Comfortable covers the first month with real furniture and a stocked kitchen. Full setup is a completely furnished apartment. Spread the spending over 2-3 months to avoid a massive one-time hit to your bank account.</p>

<h2 id="save">How to Save Money Furnishing</h2>

<h3>Buy Used First</h3>
<p>Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp are full of furniture at 50-80% off retail. People moving, downsizing, or upgrading sell perfectly good couches, tables, dressers, and desks for almost nothing. Check daily and be ready to pick up the same day for the best deals. The only things worth buying new are your mattress and pillows.</p>

<h3>Check Buy Nothing Groups</h3>
<p>Facebook Buy Nothing groups are neighborhood-based groups where people give away things for free. Furniture, kitchen items, decor, cleaning supplies. Join your local group as soon as you know your new neighborhood. People post free items daily.</p>

<h3>Ask Family and Friends</h3>
<p>Before buying anything, put out a general ask to family and friends. You would be amazed how many people have spare kitchen items, old furniture, extra towels, and random household things in their garage or basement that they are happy to give away.</p>

<h3>IKEA for New Budget Furniture</h3>
<p>When you need to buy new, IKEA offers the best prices for apartment furniture. The KALLAX shelf ($35-70), MALM dresser ($100-150), and LACK table ($10) are apartment staples for a reason. They are affordable, functional, and look decent.</p>

<h3>Do Not Buy Everything at Once</h3>
<p>Live in the space for a few weeks before buying furniture. You might think you need a dining table but realize you always eat at the couch. You might think you need a desk but find the kitchen counter works fine. Buy what you actually need, not what you think an apartment is supposed to have.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>Money Rule</h3>
<p>Spend the most on things you use the most. Your mattress gets 8 hours of use daily. Your couch gets 2-3 hours. That decorative vase gets zero. Allocate your budget accordingly. A great mattress with a cheap couch beats a cheap mattress with a great couch every single time.</p>

<div class="faq">
<details open>
<summary>How much does it cost to furnish a first apartment?</summary>
<p>$500-800 for bare essentials. $1,500-2,500 for a comfortably furnished apartment. $3,000-5,000+ if you buy everything new. Save significantly by buying furniture used from Facebook Marketplace and thrift stores.</p>

<summary>What should I buy first for my first apartment?</summary>
<p>Night one: mattress, bedding, towels, toilet paper, soap, trash bags. First week: basic kitchen supplies (pot, pan, plates, utensils). First month: furniture and comfort items. Do not buy everything before moving in.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What do most people forget when moving in?</summary>
<p>Shower curtain, toilet plunger, trash cans, light bulbs, basic tools, can opener, ice cube trays, extension cords, hangers, and first aid kit. Also: setting up utilities before move-in day and getting renters insurance.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is renters insurance necessary?</summary>
<p>Yes. $15-30/month protects your belongings against theft, fire, and water damage. Your landlord's insurance covers the building but not your stuff. Many landlords require it anyway.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What kitchen items do I actually need?</summary>
<p>One pot, one pan, a baking sheet, cutting board, chef knife, spatula, wooden spoon, can opener, 4 plates, 4 bowls, 4 cups, flatware for 4, dish soap, sponge, and dish rack. That is it for the first week.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I save money furnishing my first apartment?</summary>
<p>Buy used furniture from Facebook Marketplace (50-80% off). Join Buy Nothing groups for free items. Ask family and friends. Buy new from IKEA when you need to. Do not buy everything at once. Only buy new mattresses and pillows for hygiene reasons.</p>
